abstract = "Through the development of electronic commerce, social media and collaborative media, the social commerce appeared. Social commerce, a subset of electronic commerce, is based on social interactions in order to buy and sell goods and services. Nowadays, before buying, people give more importance to the experience feedback they found on internet. However, it is difficult to get an overview of this experience feedback since it is scattered in many online resources, and buyers never have time to read many pages of comments. In this paper, we present an approach which grabs and analyzes experience feedback in order to publish a summary of opinions about a product. We develop this approach with a case study on smartphones and publish a dataset of thousands of comments on a wide range of smartphones. To summarize experience feedback, we use a linguistic appraisal model, based on appreciation, affect and judgement, and we set up an approach using methods and tools from the fields of natural language processing, opinion mining and sentiment analysis."
