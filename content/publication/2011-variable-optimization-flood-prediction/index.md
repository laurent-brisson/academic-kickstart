abstract = "In this paper, we present an heuristic based approach for feature selection in the context of flood prediction. Features are complex variables that represent aggregate values. We apply a preprocessing method on data in order to elicit relevant information that could not be easily accessible initially because it is split through several lines of a dataset. A genetic algorithm is used in order to search for the features that may prove the best performances for flood prediction."
