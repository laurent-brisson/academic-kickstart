abstract = "According to the World Health Organization, starting from 2010, cancer has become the leading cause of death worldwide. Prevention of major cancer localizations through a quantified assessment of risk factors is a major concern in order to decrease their impact in our society. Our objective is to test the performances of a modeling method that answers to needs and constraints of end users. In this article, we follow a data mining process to build a reliable assessment tool for primary breast cancer risk. A k-nearest-neighbor algorithm is used to compute a risk score for different profiles from a public database. We empirically show that it is possible to achieve the same performances as logistic regressions with less attributes and a more easily readable model. The process includes the intervention of a domain expert, during an offline step of the process, who helps to select one of the numerous model variations by combining at best, physician expectations and performances. A risk score made of four parameters: age, breast density, number of affected first degree relatives and breast biopsy, is chosen. Detection performance measured with the area under the ROC curve is 0.637. A graphical user interface is presented to show how users will interact with this risk score."
