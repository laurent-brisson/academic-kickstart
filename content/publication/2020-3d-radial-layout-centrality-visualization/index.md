abstract: "This paper presents new methods of 3D visualization of graphs
that allow to highlight nodes structural centrality. These methods con-
sist in projecting, along the vertical axis, 2D graph representations on
three 3D surfaces: 1) a half-sphere; 2) a cone and 3) a torus portion. The
transition to 3D allows to better handle the visualization of complex and
large data that 2D techniques are generally unable to provide. The 3D
radial layout techniques reduce nodes and edges overlap and improve, in
some cases, the perception of nodes connectivity by exploiting differently
or better the display space."
