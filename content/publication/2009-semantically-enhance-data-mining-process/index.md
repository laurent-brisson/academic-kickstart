abstract = "This paper presents the KEOPS data mining methodology centered on domain knowledge integration. KEOPS is a CRISP-DM compliant methodology which integrates a knowledge base and an ontology. In this paper, we focus ﬁrst on the pre-processing steps of business understanding and data understanding in order to build an ontology driven information system (ODIS). Then we show how the knowledge base is used for the post-processing step of model interpretation. We detail the role of the ontology and we deﬁne a part-way interestingness measure that integrates both objective and subjective criteria in order to eval model relevance according to expert knowledge. We present experiments conducted on real data and their results."
