This work aims to use techniques from the analysis of social networks and machine learning to produce Learning Analytics (LA) that will support learners and teachers in changing their practices.

We are particularly interested in how the analysis of social interactions allows us to obtain insights into the dynamics of learning strategies.

This work is supported in particular by the post-doctoral work of RaphaÃ«l Charbey and the ongoing thesis work of Michael Kamau Wahiu.
