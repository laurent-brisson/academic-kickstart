This research project aims to use techniques from the analysis of social networks and machine learning to produce Learning Analytics (LA) that will support learners and teachers in changing their practices, based in particular on a dimension that is currently little exploited: the influence of social interactions. To this end, we will focus on the issue of social and collaborative learning. Numerous studies have demonstrated the influence of social relations and group work on learning mechanisms and many teachers opt for this type of pedagogical approach both for the development of scientific and transversal skills. However, there is currently no tool to analyse the impact of interactions between individuals on learning outcomes. In addition, in the field of social network analysis, the analysis of a social graph makes it possible to identify communities of influential individuals or individuals and to detect temporal patterns that allow interactions to be characterized over time. These concepts would be directly applicable to the detection of learning communities and would make it possible to identify individuals and patterns of interaction that would have a positive or negative influence on the learning process.
