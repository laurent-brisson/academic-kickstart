The goal of this project is to analyze and evaluate the socio-economic effects of digital transformations on information quality and pluralism (QPI) in the media universe.

- The written and audiovisual media are an essential link in political pluralism. Their digitisation and the explosion of online informational content are a priori conducive to the formation of plural opinions, which guarantee the proper functioning of democracy.
- However, this pluralism of content and sources is not in itself synonymous with information quality.
- Digital technology, through economic models, informational practices and media sector regulation, could redefine the concept of QPI through the proliferation of modes of production, selection and circulation of low quality information (fakes, poor content, massive information recovery...).

In a rapidly changing environment, the PIL project proposes precisely to:

- redefine the concept of quality and pluralism through an original multidisciplinary approach,
- develop innovative measurement methods for QPI,
- evaluate current instruments for regulating pluralism and make recommendations.
