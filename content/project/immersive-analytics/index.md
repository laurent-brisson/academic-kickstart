This work aims to develop new methods of data exploration and analysis using immersion techniques in 3D environments.

We are particularly interested here in the development of graph visualization techniques to allow:

- an intuitive visualization of the centrality of nodes (in the sense defined in the field of social network analysis by closeness, betweenness, pagerank...)
- the ability to navigate between several levels of detail (from the community graph to the communities themselves)

This work is based on the ongoing thesis work of Piriziw√® Kobina.
